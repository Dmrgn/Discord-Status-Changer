# Discord Status Changer

Change your Discord status programmatically from nodejs or python.

Look at the scripts main.js and main.py for examples.

You will probably get banned by using this tool, so don't use it :)

Make sure to not set your status more than once every 15 seconds or else Discord will detect it.

This will not be updated and only works with the Discord api v9 which is likely to be replaced eventually if not soon.
